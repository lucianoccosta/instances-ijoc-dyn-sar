# Instances

Repository containing the datasets that were considered in the paper "Costa, Luciano; Contardo, Claudio; Desaulniers, Guy; Yarkony, Julian. Stabilized column generation via the dynamic separation of aggregated rows" accepted to be published in INFORMS Journal on Computing. 

Each folder contains instances files, as well as a README file, for the following problems:

* Bin Packing Problem with Conflicts: Newly generated datasets for the Bin Packing Problem with Conflicts (BPPC) with arbitrary conflict graphs.

* Multi-Person Pose Estimation Problem: The datasets have been proposed by Andriluka et al. (2014) but were made available in this repository for the convenience of the reader.

* Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows: The datasets have been downloaded from <https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top/vrptw/homberger-benchmark/documentation/> but were made available in this repository for the convenience of the reader.
